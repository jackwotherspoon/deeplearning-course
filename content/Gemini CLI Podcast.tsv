0	5800	This week, on The Agent Factory, it's the agentic looping action.
5800	8000	I'm not very good at like sitting down and reading.
8000	11800	My re-later folder has its own gravitational pull.
11800	16000	With AI, using AI these days, it is so easy to 10x to yourself.
16000	19000	100x and that's the hard part.
19000	22000	Yeah, and my mom watches these, so mom, I'm still alive.
22000	32000	Hi, everyone, and welcome to The Agent Factory, the podcast that goes beyond the hype,
32000	35000	and dives into building production-ready AI agents.
35000	37000	I'm Molly Bennett.
37000	38000	And I'm Emma Morage.
38000	42000	And today, we're going to be diving deep into the Gemini CLI.
42000	48000	So we used the CLI a bit in our last episode, including this live vibe coding demo
48000	49000	that was a ton of fun.
49000	52000	I suggest you check it out if you haven't seen it yet.
52000	55000	I'm really excited to show it off in more detail.
55000	61000	And for anyone who hasn't heard or haven't, hasn't heard of or used the Gemini CLI yet,
61000	65000	it's a really powerful agent, lives right in your command line,
65000	69000	and it's designed to help you with your everyday workflows.
69000	74000	Yeah, and I'm really excited because in this episode, we're actually going to show you how to use Gemini CLI
74000	78000	or getting up to speed on a new code base, super charging your research,
78000	82000	and how you can use it to integrate it into your own automations.
82000	86000	Yeah, and to help us do that, we're very excited to have Taylor Mullin,
86000	89000	the creator of Gemini CLI with us today.
89000	93000	We're going to pick his brain about the philosophy behind the tool,
93000	96000	and what's next on the roadmap, which I'm very excited to hear about.
96000	97000	Yeah, I can't wait.
97000	100000	I mean, I've been using the CLI now for a few weeks,
100000	103000	and I already feel like it's become a mainstay in my workflow.
103000	105000	What about you, Molly, what's your take?
105000	107000	Oh, yeah, no, I'm totally sold.
107000	111000	For me, the biggest thing is that it lives in the terminal,
111000	115000	where I do my work, and I was also able to add a directly to VS code,
115000	118000	the IDE I use, so that was super handy.
118000	121000	Yeah, I feel like having it integrated into so many different tools
121000	123000	makes it indispensable.
123000	126000	And also on that note, having Taylor with us here today,
126000	130000	who's going to be able to tell us even more about the background in philosophy,
130000	133000	behind Gemini CLI, will be invaluable.
133000	139000	But before we talk to Taylor, let's get hands-on with some demos on the facts before.
139000	145000	Let's tackle a universal developer problem,
145000	148000	which is onboarding onto a new code base.
148000	150000	I think all of us have had to do this at some point.
150000	156000	I'm going to go ahead and show how the Gemini CLI can help speed up this onboarding process.
157000	161000	Okay, yeah, so code base exploration, that sounds pretty cool.
161000	165000	And I feel like this will also be a really good showcase for Gemini CLI's massive
165000	168000	1 million token context window.
168000	172000	I feel like that's kind of the difference between asking questions about a single file
172000	175000	versus maybe the entire architecture all at one.
175000	177000	Yeah, yeah, totally.
177000	182000	And so to start, I'm actually not even going to clone the repo myself.
182000	185000	I'm just going to ask the agent to do it for me.
185000	189000	So I've decided to use Google's ADK repo for this example.
189000	192000	So ADK stands for agent development kit.
192000	200000	So I'm just going to say clone the Google ADK Python repo from GitHub.
200000	205000	And I'm going to see what it does.
205000	211000	Okay, so it's searching the web trying to find the right link.
211000	212000	Awesome.
212000	213000	It found the right link.
213000	216000	It's asking me for permission to clone it.
216000	221000	Go ahead.
221000	222000	Cool.
222000	225000	Yeah, and this looks like it's the agent group in action.
225000	228000	It's kind of reasoning that it needs a piece of information.
228000	231000	It then chooses a tool to get that information looks like.
231000	234000	And then it uses that information to complete the original request.
234000	238000	And then also at the same time, it asks you if you want to proceed.
238000	239000	Checking back in.
239000	242000	So yeah, this is a super helpful workflow.
242000	252000	I think the way I want to tackle this is let's imagine that we're like a new contributor to this project.
252000	259000	What do you think is the first like what's the first thing you'd want to do if you were a new contributor to a project and you wanted to figure out how to go forward.
259000	262000	Feel like I would want to get a high level understanding of the project.
262000	265000	I think I learned best maybe from like a top down perspective.
265000	269000	Things like text stack, how code of structure, stuff like that.
269000	273000	Yeah, yeah, totally like in the past.
273000	276000	And then not so distant past actually.
276000	279000	You know, you might start with like reading a read me file.
279000	282000	Maybe contributing file.
282000	285000	You know, start piecing things together that way.
285000	286000	And like.
286000	291000	I'm not very good at like sitting down and reading a huge amount of documentation to be quite honest.
291000	298000	So instead, I'm going to ask the Gemini CLI to perform a high level audit of the entire directory.
298000	301000	So let's see.
301000	305000	I'm going to ask the Gemini CLI agent for a complete project overview.
305000	312000	I want it to tell me the purpose, the text stack and analyze architecture all in one go.
312000	319000	Yeah, and I feel like that's much more powerful than just relying on one read me document.
319000	322000	This way you can kind of point at the whole directory.
322000	325000	And it's cool because you're asking it to like synthesize everything.
325000	332000	The source, file, the docs, all of the code into a single coherent sort of overview, right?
332000	333000	Yeah.
333000	334000	Yeah, absolutely.
334000	343000	Yeah, it's like it's ingesting the entire directory to build out this like complete mental model of the project, which is super helpful.
343000	345000	Okay, great.
345000	353000	Starting to output this looks really good and helpful.
353000	359000	Yeah, identified the purpose, the text stack, core dependencies, all that good stuff.
359000	362000	That's like helpful to kind of know what the outlet.
362000	364000	Yeah, it's really verbose what it did.
364000	368000	Summary, I wouldn't have been able to write it better myself, right?
368000	369000	Yeah.
369000	372000	And now for the part of the show that we've both been waiting for.
372000	377000	We're going to shift gears and get a deep dive into the philosophy and future of Gemini CLI.
377000	383000	We'd now like to welcome to the podcast Taylor Mullin, creator of Gemini CLI.
383000	385000	Taylor, thank you so much for joining us.
385000	386000	Thanks for having me.
386000	387000	This is fun to be here.
387000	389000	Yeah, so let's start at the very beginning.
389000	393000	Could you tell us the origin story of the Gemini CLI?
393000	397000	Like, what was the initial spark or inspiration that led to it?
397000	398000	And how did things go from there?
398000	399000	I'm very curious to hear.
399000	401000	Oh, yeah, it's kind of crazy.
401000	405000	It started about a year and a half ago, weirdly enough, right?
405000	406000	It's so long ago.
406000	414000	But like, at the time, I was experimenting with multi agent systems and trying to get like the most out of our elements.
414000	420000	And so at the time, like, I had the system where the multiple personas, they were talking to each other and they were doing a lot of cool things.
420000	422000	And it was surfaced in a lot of different ways.
422000	426000	It was surfaced in IDE, it was surfaced in a CLI.
426000	428000	It was surfaced in the web.
428000	434000	And as I was playing with these things, the thing that really stuck for me was the CLI.
434000	437000	It was so easy to use, so lightweight.
437000	447000	But at the time, like, it took 30 requests, like one user request resulted in like 30 LLM requests behind the scenes.
447000	450000	And those 30 requests was a lot for the time.
450000	453000	It took a minute and a half to respond to anything.
453000	455000	And the quality was there.
455000	459000	Like, this was something at the time that was just too much.
459000	462000	Like, we also have limited context window.
462000	470000	And so in that realm, it being a CLI and it having all these constraints, we scrapped the project.
470000	472000	And that was kind of challenging at the time.
472000	474000	It was almost a little bit too early.
474000	475000	Yeah.
475000	480000	It was one of those things like, okay, no one's going to want to use this because it cost too much.
480000	482000	It couldn't absorb enough information.
482000	488000	And it took too long to respond, which is kind of a trippy thing like fast forwarding today, right?
488000	491000	We're very much used to, you have deep research, like you click a button.
491000	495000	And then you go off and you get a coffee and you come back and hopefully it's done.
495000	496000	And it's crazy.
496000	498000	It's so different.
498000	502000	But during that time, like, it was too early.
502000	508000	And then today, like me, Google and me, I'm really trying to like build this future of developer tools.
508000	514000	Like, there was this ecosystem of CLIs that was just taking hold in the community, right?
514000	518000	And it really proved that people are willing to wait.
518000	522000	People are willing to use a CLI.
522000	525000	And they find it, they found it as compelling as they I did back then.
525000	527000	It's like, when all this started to happen, I'm like, oh my goodness.
527000	532000	Maybe I was just too early and maybe we should try and give this another go.
532000	538000	And so that like, I really grounded at least the motivation of saying, okay, I've done this before.
538000	545000	And like, I've learned a lot over my entire career of what it means to build developer tools and what it means.
545000	550000	It's like, build something that can kind of span a lot of ecosystems.
550000	553000	And so we started Gemini CLI from that point.
553000	557000	So it's like, I basically, I went dark, obviously, I went dark for like a week.
557000	560000	And I'm like, okay, I'm going to do this.
560000	564000	I have this idea that went dark for a week, talked to no one, spent every waking second,
564000	567000	was getting like five to six hours of sleep in the night.
567000	570000	And this was like, I think it was like Saturday through Saturday.
570000	572000	Saturday through Sunday or something like that.
572000	576000	And then like that Monday, I had a prototype, did a video.
576000	581000	I put it out and Googlers started just going like wild for it.
581000	582000	It was super cool.
582000	584000	Yeah, thanks so much for sharing that.
584000	590000	And so I guess building on that, you know, making the Gemini CLI open source was a very deliberate choice, I think,
590000	595000	which you've linked to security and learning and a whole host of other things.
595000	604000	So how does this open, trust-based approach contrast with the more like black box nature of other maybe major AI tools out there?
604000	610000	And what kind of ecosystem do you hope that this will foster the transparency will foster?
610000	612000	Yeah, it's like to be frigate.
612000	615000	I started my career in open source.
615000	621000	Like I have always been in developer tooling or framework to one thing and the other and open source has been like front and center.
621000	625000	So like from day zero, that was a key thing in my head.
625000	628000	But most folks feel like, oh, it's open source.
628000	630000	Why would you not go ahead and do it?
630000	632000	Open source is not free.
632000	633000	It's not free.
633000	636000	It's actually a very challenging thing to get right.
636000	639000	But oh my gosh, it's so rewarding when you do.
639000	645000	So like knowing this, it was always this question like, okay, let's weigh the actual balance.
645000	652000	Like should it be open source should not be in the answers ended being like obviously it should be open source, like especially with a CLI tool like this.
652000	657000	That's forward like for a wide variety of people and of course developers as well.
657000	663000	But something that people could see and could understand, okay, it's running on my box.
663000	665000	It has a lot of capability.
665000	667000	So what does it do and can I trust it?
667000	670000	It's like that kind of like you mentioned the security aspect.
670000	674000	That was one of our biggest reasons for like open sourcing this.
674000	677000	We want people to see exactly how it operates.
677000	679000	So they can have they can have trust.
679000	681000	They know we're not doing anything behind the scenes.
681000	683000	They know exactly what's happening.
683000	687000	And also means that if we make a mistake.
687000	692000	That we can fix it that we have the entire community to help keep us grounded.
692000	697000	And what makes the most secure sense we to be frank, we struggle to keep up.
697000	701000	We totally struggle to keep up with all the energy they give.
701000	705000	But to be frank, it's one of the most important things that we have.
705000	713000	And so when people ask me like, what is the number one thing that's on your mind for Jim and I see a line like it's our open source community.
713000	715000	Like by far, it's number one.
715000	718000	And that's like, I think we've shut down the team.
718000	726000	Like literally everyone on the team for like days in order to make sure that we can try and keep up with the amount of traction and the amount of energy coming at us.
726000	728000	But I think that's because we see the value.
728000	733000	We see how valuable it is to kind of build this in the open together.
733000	737000	So that folks have that confidence that we're doing the right thing.
737000	741000	And we have that confidence we're building the right things as well.
741000	742000	And it's funny.
742000	744000	We actually still do the updates today.
744000	755000	Actually on all of our socials will post every single week on Wednesdays will post like 100 to 150 features weekly features bugs enhancements all the above.
755000	758000	You said 150 features a week, right?
758000	761000	That's a lot.
761000	766000	What are the mechanisms that you use you and the team used to make that possible?
766000	770000	Because we use it to build itself like it allows us to.
770000	778000	Allow us to do a lot more like one of the coolest things I think that we started doing is when you teach it to boot itself.
778000	783000	It means it can spin up parallel like threads simultaneously.
783000	786000	And each of those can go ahead and tackle different problems.
786000	794000	Combine that with work get work trees and you're going even further so far gone are the days of being able to ship like twice a year.
794000	797000	Which is a huge part of software historically.
797000	802000	Because in AI every single week is like an insane amount of time.
802000	805000	Every single month is like yeah.
805000	807000	Absolutely.
807000	812000	So I think it's it's honestly it's just that it's a mindset such cultural thing that we've built.
812000	816000	And I also want to kind of acknowledge our open source community again as well.
816000	823000	Which is they really help make it possible because without folks really contributing helping each other out even.
823000	833000	I don't know how easy it would it would be like we put human eyes on every single one of the changes that go and we don't we're not just like letting things go without looking at them.
833000	843000	It's just we have a lot of really passionate really smart capable and motivated people to kind of make the right decisions at scale.
843000	852000	You use Gemini CLI to build Gemini CLI so I'm curious to tell a little bit more about how that journey started and and kind of what was your favorite part of it.
852000	858000	Yeah, it's kind of nuts like I still remember actually the first feature it built for itself.
858000	865000	Which is it's kind of crazy it was I see it's so long but it really wasn't that long ago.
865000	871000	But early on we knew that markdown rendering was going to be important right.
871000	878000	So I'm sitting there and I'm trying to build out its ability to render mark down a set of seeing the raw markdowns in the terminal.
878000	891000	And there was a lot of utilities and frameworks to make this possible and I kept I forget the exact of the wall that I was hitting but I kept hitting a wall and using one of these frameworks that was like just a limiter and this was a hard stop for me.
891000	904000	And okay, like I need to progress I need to do something and I ended up asking hey like what are my options as the first I'm just asking is that when I was asking it more questions to tell learn more.
904000	909000	And it's like oh I can write a markdown parser for you.
909000	918000	I said cool go for it. And so this is the first time when it one shot its own markdown rendering.
918000	922000	And to be frank the variant of that is still used today that actually renders.
922000	928000	So if you're ever curious like if like Gemini CLI has written a significant amount of its own code.
928000	931000	It's super significant amount so cool.
931000	960000	Yeah, it's we doubt like I think the biggest thing that we think about on the team is with AI using AI these days it is so easy to 10X yourself which sounds crazy to say but 10Xing is easy these days 100Xing that's the hard part like that is where you really start getting into how can I parallelize my workflows to make sure my time that I'm investing in each of these things is best spent.
960000	977000	Because models themselves that we talked about it there like there's so much that's left unsaid when asking a question they it still needs human feedback a lot of the times in order to be effective like things don't just get one shot of the right of course you see that in all the videos out there and like all the highlights.
977000	988000	But one shoting rarely happens so how do you optimize your time to make it so that multi shot scenarios are the land super well they can really amplify what you do.
988000	1003000	Another thing I'm curious about is are there any like methodologies you think about when using Gemini CLI like what's your mentality on how the tool operates is grounded in a lot of my developer background especially with AI.
1003000	1027000	Which is I personally feel like there's so much that's left unsaid when people will do a prop so like one of the big things is this is context engineering it's kind of grounded in the same mindset which is when you ask a question to your AI of choice you're giving it as much information as you possibly can to enable it to derive the right answer.
1027000	1046000	Now of course you're also leaning on its ability to like figure out more information and dig through your co base or whatever you're by doing at the time but that alone is really challenging spot because it can't know those offline conversations you have with your colleague or your friend it can't know.
1047000	1065000	Usually doesn't know your emails and your chat messages but it doesn't typically know that all those pieces of context really feed into building a coherent response so if you're currently writing tests and you ask to go ahead and implement something chances are you want to implement that in the form of tests.
1065000	1094000	Your current workflow that methodology though it kind of rings true with every decision we make I think the thing I tell the team is that do what a person would do and don't take shortcuts so one thing I might be surprising to folks is we don't use embeddings like for instance for search we do not index your code base we do a gentick search which means how you as a person or use as a developer would dig through a piece of code we do the same thing.
1095000	1121000	We'll do fine we'll do we'll we'll grab our way through the code base we'll open files or read them will effectively run commands like find all references on your behalf if we need to to find out what's the next piece of the puzzle because in the end we're trying to provide the right context to the LM so that it's grounded in every single thing it does to come to a good a good result so I think you think it's probably it was probably the biggest one.
1122000	1133000	I think that kind of really resonates with us something that I think is really cool is like maybe I'll ask the CLI to do something and it'll try to do the thing but be like well I can't actually do this.
1134000	1145000	But then you'll give me the steps that it needs to take in order to do it and be like are you okay with me going ahead and doing these steps to do the thing that I need to do to get to your original request which is very cool.
1146000	1165000	I love that's the that's such a huge unlock is the we call it self-healing it's ability to self-heal goes so far and like when it they'll try things like it has a good idea of what's on your box and to try to use all those things that when it can't do it it's so good at coming of other alternatives like I recall this one scenario.
1165000	1176000	I was talking to our marketing folks and I was giving them a demo to show what it could do and then the first question was oh can I like can you give me a link to this and I'm like oh.
1177000	1187000	It's we don't we don't have built in like deploy functionality like there's a cloud run and there's a cloud run extension actually being released very soon that will enable this just the folks know.
1188000	1193000	But we don't have that built in and so they're asking how can you do this I'm like okay well let me just ask.
1194000	1216000	And what it did is it ended up like creating a GitHub repository and GitHub repositories have a thing called GitHub pages which allows you to host static content and then it pushed this content to it and it gave me a link and I gave it I'm like I had never even considered that my question was how do I give this person like it but all the other pieces together to kind of make that a reality.
1216000	1230000	Like the scrap scrapiest developer yeah I'm almost thinking of the use case where I'm like hey Gemini CLI how can I like tell my mom that I'm still alive like up there and it'll like ask me maybe you should do that but hear the steps that I would take like are you okay.
1231000	1233000	I think about the text messages and whatever.
1234000	1238000	Totally yeah and my mom watches these so mom I'm still alive.
1238000	1247000	Well and also a moment ago you mentioned something about like an upcoming feature on the roadmap.
1248000	1255000	So what else like what else is coming up on the roadmap like are there any features coming up that you're most excited for.
1255000	1272000	Because we view Gemini CLI as being a lot more than just developers and because we've seen internally it's unlocking every profession whether you're a marketer or a financial to of course the software developer it kind of tax that hits all those buttons to make it so we can work with every one of these professions.
1273000	1284000	We're really doubling down an extensibility so you can heavily extend Gemini CLI and this is not just MCP servers this is literally you can install an extension which is a bundle of it could be available.
1285000	1295000	MCP servers specific instructions specific commands lots of different things to drive a different so this is the cloud run one that I had mentioned earlier they have an extension.
1296000	1308000	And this extension can be Gemini extensions install and then even passing cloud run and it's seamless installation but enables you to really curate the experience to your like your preferences.
1308000	1328000	So for instance if you are like a go developer and you want to make sure your environment is super go friendly like you'll install the right MCP servers to make that happen right or if you are it's a content generator maybe you'll hook it up to all your various socials maybe you'll create a generative media APIs you'll also hook that up to it.
1328000	1353000	So being able to turn these on and off is something that's super important to us because we know that there's a lot of use cases and so the big so that's the biggest feature that we're going to be talking about soon which is how to build these extensions how to install them manage them with the intention of making this super seamless for people where people can spin up their own registries for they want to we're going to have eventually going to have like a centralized registry for all of our extensions.
1354000	1363000	But the extension ecosystem is going to be the big one I can't wait to see what people build like we have a number of them coming out from Google from from cloud.
1365000	1370000	And just in general to really hook Gemini CLI into everything in a really seamless way.
1371000	1381000	Yeah Taylor I just wanted to thank you so much for sharing your insights with us in our audience of agent builders it's been a fascinating look behind the curtain of Gemini CLI and you've shared so much with us so so I want to thank you.
1382000	1407000	Oh thanks for having me this has been an amazing conversation like I love I love diving in and especially love just sharing stories and if you haven't checked this out checks out on GitHub you'll find us all the amazing like Gemini Google dash Gemini slash Gemini CLI and get up and then of course you can look for us in socials as well to get those weekly updates that we push out regularly.
1408000	1411000	Oh yeah good plug yeah thank you so much Taylor this is so fun.
1412000	1413000	Yeah thanks so much Taylor.
1414000	1421000	And that's our show for today thank you for joining us for this deep dive into the Gemini CLI we highly recommend you try it out for yourself.
1422000	1433000	And if you enjoyed this episode of the agent factory check us out next time where we'll continue diving into the world of AI agents until then I'm Emmett Mirage and I'm Molly Pettit.
1433000	1435000	Power it down.
